# libraries
This folder contains libraries required for the LearnByMaking series of kit. 

Most of these libraries are external libraries written and maintained by other authors. In some cases no changes are made to the original libraries while in other cases, ThingsPingÂ® has made changes. Where changes have been made, we have mentioned this as comments in the code. The reason for having a separate folder for these libraries is to have one centralized location for the required libraries instead of pointing to several locations. This makes the flow of our tutorials more intuitive and simple

We have retained the original license for each library.
